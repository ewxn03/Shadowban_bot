A javascript puppateer application for detecting whether or not a user is still shadowbanned in the game Call of Duty. At this stage the application can login to the activision site and
then navigate to the ban appeal page and then extract the text in a html element which will either say "NO BAN DETECTED" indicating the user isnt shadow banned
or "LIMITED MATCHMAKING" which indicates the user is shadowbanned. At this current stage the script is needed to be manually run each time as the script currently needs manual intervention
to bypass a reCAPTCHA.
